Function vs Form: When are webimages considered part of the content (HTML) as opposed to part of the appearance (CSS)?

Webimages would be considered part of HTML when they are actionable - i.e. u need to click on an image as if it
was a button, or sections of an image are used as clickable regions

In CSS images are used as solid color would be used - to fill in a region with specific design or in the case of 
animation CSS to show a certain effect on the screen.
