What is the difference between ID's, Classes and Tags?

    ID's identify a specific element on a page
    Class can be assigned to multiple elements so u can change appearance of multiple elements with on CSS styling directive
    HTML tag indicates HTML element we want to render on a page


How does Specificity play a role in the selection of HTML elements
(both in CSS and JS) ?

    We specify styles starting from top down - so as example, we give EVERY HTML DIV tag overflow attribute
    and then specifically override that attribute for for a DIV that is further down in the page hierarchy
