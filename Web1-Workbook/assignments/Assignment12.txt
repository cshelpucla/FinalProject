What is considered the right size for an image or video asset?

The right size is a compromise beetween legibility/clarity and speed of rendering of the image
Legibility implies that we want to render image with as much detail and color depth as possible
Speed implies we want the image to be smallest size possible ( that is where formats come in SVG vs PNG etc.)
and to still clearly display it on screen.  Vector images are small size but take time to render, .pngs
take time to download but render faster.
